Data found on government websites on blackspots in each state was taken and the exact latitude and longitude was found out using a geocoder present within excel.
An excel sheet was then made using the full address obtained, the latitude and the longitude.
This was then inserted into the QGIS tool that we used with the help of certain extensions.
Shapefile of the state was added to the same and the points were mapped.
The above process was repeated for each state.
